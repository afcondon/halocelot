# Interfaces

This section holds the JavaScript interfaces for various Halogen components. These provide easy interop for teams who wish to use these Halogen components within JavaScript applications.

## Setup

To play around with the example code, follow these steps:

```sh
# Install and build the library
npm i && npx pulp build

# Move to the test/interop directory
cd test/Interop/

# Now we're in a pretend project that depends on Ocelot.
# Install Node dependencies
npm i

# You can view the running code:
open dist/index.html

# You can modify the source:
vim src/index.js

# And rebuild with webpack
npx webpack
```
